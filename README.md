## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virat-kohli-tribute.git
    cd virat-kohli-tribute
    ```

2. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. At this point you're on your own.
